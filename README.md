## Evaluation 
* Individual paper, limited to 8 content pages
* Pass/fail
* Ideas for the paper: 
  - Replicate a previous work with your own data and problem setting 
  - Propose a new idea/model, related to your own research, clearly stating the research question(s), method(s) (including the derivation of the ELBO), and experimental design
